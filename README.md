# minimax-tictactoe
Pythonic representation of the minimax algorithm with numpy and minimal looping

## Introduction
Perhaps the most primitive and well-known algorithm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the minimax algorithm utilizes decision rules and lookahead to minimize loss, then maximize gain.  As a recursive algorithm, minimax utilizes historical information to enumerate all possible future states.

This project is a work in progress.
